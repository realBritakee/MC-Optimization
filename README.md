# MC-Optimization-Guide

The end-all, be-all optimization guide for various Minecraft versions.

**NOTE:**
This guide only covers performance mods that are deemed "necessary", so duplicate mods that do the same thing (eg. Rubidium and Embeddium, Radon and Starlight, etc.) won't be included.

It also takes a fairly minimalist approach. This means that while there may be a way to squeeze out a couple fps more with additional mods, the mods listed here should be more than enough for smooth and lag-free gameplay.

Inspired by [UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) and various Reddit threads, as well as my own testing.

## FAQ

Q: Why isn't `mod x` on any of the lists?

A: A list of mods that aren't recommended (and why) can be found [here](mods-n-stuff/not-recommended.md)

Q: Why isn't `version x.y.z` supported?

A: I only maintain lists for Minecraft versions that still see active mod development.

Q: Will these work on PojavLauncher?

A: Maybe, maybe not. Try it and see. Pojav compatibility isn't a priority since most players are on PC.
